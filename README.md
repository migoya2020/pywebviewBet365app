So just aesthetically some small changes:

1. Could the size of the notification within the app be made slightly smaller to be able to see more at once?

2. Colour coding messages - Birdie = Blue, Eagle = Yellow, Bogey or worse = Orange, Water/Penalty = Red

Score changes and other messages can stay green for now

The OGR messages need a slight tweak so that it's OGR in 2 shots less than the par of the hole AND distance = 15 feet or less.

For Par 4/5's only could we add a rule that is On Green in 3 shots less than Par.

Would it be possible to add the ability to deselect/ignore players from the notifications? Would help later in the week with getting rid of players who can no longer win
