# Bet365GolfNotifyMe

https://www.bet365.com/#/AS/B7/

This app was developed to Display only relevant Bet365Golf realTime Inplay Notifications for a selected Tournament.

The Frontend uses ```https://pywebview.flowrl.com/``` as a GUI and Python websockets as a Backend.

**UPDATE: Bet365.com changed their websockets in January 2022. So the App will not currently load the Tournaments. However, am currenlty working on a new backend, so check back soon.**

**See it in action**
